# Command Keys
Safari-style access to your bookmarks bar using command/control 1-9.

# Notes
Command Keys is merely [Bookmark Keys](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3647) updated to work with Firefox 3.*.

Works perfectly on OS X and Linux. Broken on Windows for now.

# Install
Drag the XPI onto Firefox.

# TODO
* Keys for accessing bookmarks higher than 1-9
