# Command Keys
Safari-style access to your bookmarks bar using command/control 1-9.

# Notes
Command Keys is merely [Bookmark Keys](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3647) updated to work with  Firefox 3.0. 

Command Keys is untested on Windows and Linux, so YMMV.

# Install
Drag the XPI onto Firefox.

# Customizing
Currently to change your modifier key, go to `about:config` and change `extensions.command_keys.modifiers` to your key of choice.

### Keys
* Command/Apple key - `meta`
* Control - `control`

# TODO
* Have preferences set via GUI.
